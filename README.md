# Natural Language Processing

Projects roughly from [Udacity NLP nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/natural-language-processing-nanodegree--nd892). Below them are some topics I've covered so far.

# Review Projects

- Sentiment Analysis in 30 lines ([details](1_Movie_Review_Analysis))
- Caesar Cipher Decryption ([details](2_Caesar_Cipher))
- English to French machine translation ([details](3_English_to_French))

# Main Topics

**Language Structure** - part of speech tagging, hidden Markov model (HMM), Bayes theorem, Bag of Words

**Math for Topic Modelling** - GLoVe, Word2vec, Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), Dirichlet distributions (alpha-beta), matrix factorization

**RNN Networks** - simple RNN, Bidirectional RNN, Sequence to Sequence, LSTM, Additive Attention -> Multiplicative Attention -> Self-Attention

**Traditional Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** - voice user interface, fast fourier transform (library implementation), Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients MFCCs), phonetics, HMM implementation, N-grams Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

**New Paradigm for ASR** - Deep learning, CNN for audio feature extraction, RNN for time series data, CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) for audio-word sequencing
