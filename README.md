# Natural Language Processing

With some old memory about NLP, I enrolled in [Udacity NLP nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/natural-language-processing-nanodegree--nd892) free trial and hacked together a few RNN models to pick up some concepts again. The materials only covered up to self-attention (not up-to-date) but let me remember how to English again. 

# Main Topics

**Language Structure** - part of speech tagging, hidden Markov model (HMM), Bayes theorem, Bag of Words

**Math for Topic Modelling** - GLoVe, Word2vec, Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), Dirichlet distributions (alpha-beta), matrix factorization

**RNN Networks** - simple RNN, Bidirectional RNN, Sequence to Sequence, LSTM, Additive Attention -> Multiplicative Attention -> Self-Attention

**Traditional Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** - voice user interface, fast fourier transform (library implementation), Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients MFCCs), phonetics, HMM implementation, N-grams Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

**New Paradigm for ASR** - Deep learning, CNN for audio feature extraction, RNN for time series data, CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) for audio-word sequencing

The Udacity Nanodegree program provided great assistance. It provided me with decent GPU (Tesla K80).
